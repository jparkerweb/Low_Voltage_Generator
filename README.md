Low Voltage Generator
=====================

Low Voltage Generator is a simple html page that uses javascript to generate links to commonly used "scene" search engines.  The various links generated are grouped into sections (e.g., nzb, newznab, torrent, xdcc, predb, etc.).  Each link will open the respective search page in a new window and pass in your searched for term (e.g., Dexter s07e11).  This makes life easier :)  This should save you time, as you can use Low Voltage Generator as your jumping off point, without having to visit each search site and search for your content seperatly.

Installation
------------
Because Low Voltage Generator is a static html page utilizing javascript, just simply download the package and open lowvoltagegenerator.html with your favorite browser.  Static html and javascript was used to enable more people to run it without knowing how to setup a web server, etc.
